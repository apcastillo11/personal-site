        <p>
          Hello, my name is Alejandra. I sometimes go by Aly. I am an aspiring
          software developer. I have experience with HTML, CSS, JavaScript, and
          Bootstrap. I am learning how to code Responsive websites. I also have
          an MBA with a concentration in Finance, so I am open to exploring
          projects that incorporate both coding and finance.

          <h3>California Lutheran University - Thousand Oaks</h3>
          <p>Master in Business Administration, 2021</p>
          <p>
            During my MBA program, the majority of my classes had projects that
            required students to look over the financial statements for
            well-known publicly traded companies. This allowed us to analyze
            financial metrics, bankruptcy risk, weighted cost of capital, and
            valuations to make projections about the future of companies. To
            provide a well-rounded experience, my program also required us to
            look at business theories and concepts outside the realm of finance.
            For example, my classmates and I also looked for ways to apply
            Porter’s Five Forces, SWOT/TOWS analysis, and Blue Ocean Strategy
            when we worked on projects. Finally, my MBA program required a good
            amount of group work, so I believe that I now have many hours of
            practice working with and directing a team.

          <h3>University of California, Los Angeles - California</h3>
          <p>Bachelor of Arts in Spanish, 2013</p>
          <p>
            During my undergraduate studies, I completed a degree in Spanish
            with minors in Public Health and in Latin American Studies. As part
            of attaining a well-rounded education, I participated in two study
            abroad programs. I studied abroad in Chile and Spanish, during which
            I lived with locals who only spoke to me in the host language.
